Wilbur stories

- the day he tried to follow Maggie out of her doggie door - don't know how he made it out since it was for a small dog, but he did! - never tried it again, tho

- the day he jumped into the creek at my townhouse because he saw a duck - you had to climb down and drag him out - it was winter and he was freezing cold so you had to rush him back to the house to get him warm

- sleeping in my bed, buried under covers so that only his tail showed

- the 'famous' pulling-me-down-the-stairs story

Love, Mom
