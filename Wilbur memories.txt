I definitely don't do journaling often. But Wilbur just had that lump on his leg removed, and the one on his chest. He's doing fine, great even...he's been a stalwart companion the whole time he has been with me. That's why I'm so broken up right now...he's 10, he won't be with me forever. And I'm starting to see signs on the horizon of that. It started with his muzzle turning grey, and then he started sleeping in longer in the mornings. It's more effort to stand up off the couch, rough breathing at night. Things like that. He's still got a lot of mileage left, though. It's been hell over the last 3 days keeping him from bouncing off the wall with a dozen staples in his leg and more in his chest, so I'm not real worried right now.

But it's inevitable.

So, being awake in the middle of the night, and unable to sleep because I know that someday I will lose my best, longest-standing, and most faithful friend, I started wondering how best I could honor him and the memories he will leave me with.

First, I'm going to make the most of the time that we've got left. Wallowing in this future pain makes no rational sense, because I'll have to pass through that gate eventually. But I can make more memories, even if one half dies with Wilbur and the other with me. Which is probably part of this emotional trainwreck...it's bringing my own mortality, and that of everyone I love, to light.

Second, I'll write down all of the memories that we have together, so that I have something to look back on. I haven't taken enough pictures of the middle of his life; I've always been terrible about that. But I've got ones from the day I brought him home, and other good pictures and memories throughout our time together. I'll start to take more, or better yet have Tracy (or Stella!) do that, so I can get in some of them. But the big thing is going to be the memories, so that I don't forget those.

It's been a while. 14 months, to be exact. But today might have been it...Wilbur had some nasty pain in his abdomen this morning, so he and I went off to the emergency vet. I was worried that it was some candy wrappers that got stuck (a week ago, he got 12-14 of the vending-size ones out of a box on the counter). So he got some x-rays taken, along with some blood work.

But it was worse than I thought. He's likely got pretty bad cancer on his left kidney, which is now obstructed. The poor guy can't pass anything with it, so it is just slowly filling up. And it's painful...he's never been a whimpery type, but it was pretty bad this morning and hasn't gotten much better. I vaguely recall Dr Peterson saying to keep an eye on it, since he had high creatinine levels. So, maybe I shouldn't have been so shocked.

The emergency vet gave me the option to bring him home and put him on pain pills overnight, or to have them keep him until morning. Of course I brought him home. We sat out in the back yard in the grass while the sedation (from xrays/ultrasounds) wore off, and the girls and Marbles ran around playing; Mom got to call and video chat with him. It was nice and peaceful, and I wish I had done more of that in the past. Then we came inside for dinner, and Wilbur got a good amount (hopefully not too much) instant-pot chicken for his dinner. He didn't seem much interested in anything else. But at least he liked that, and he kept it down. So that's a plus. He's still got some fight left in him.

Tonight, we are all going to pile into bed together in our room. The girls are a bit worked up; I think Stella has a vague understanding, but Eliza has been asking a lot of questions, so I think she understands what is going on and what might happen. They've both been very good today, and helpful with Wilbur to keep him happy and comfortable.

Tomorrow morning, we are going to a different vet, to talk about the possibility of exploratory surgery to remove the bad (cancerous?) kidney and see what else is going on. I want to have hope, and have been praying. But I think it might be a long shot, and it would probably only get us another 8-16 months together. I hate that part of my decision is financial, for such an amazing dog and friend. But that's reality, for pets, unfortunately. If I can't afford the surgery option, or if something crazy happens, I am terrified I'll have to have him put to sleep.

I'm mad at myself for not making better use of our time over the last 14 months. And I am sad I haven't expanded on any of these stories, but so, so happy that I wrote this down initially and at least have a starting point.

Wilbur has been the best dog that anyone could ask for, and I hope I've been a good friend to him. I love the big guy, and so do Tracy and the girls. We will all miss him, if it comes to that tomorrow.
