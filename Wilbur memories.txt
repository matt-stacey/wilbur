I definitely don't do journaling often. But Wilbur just had that lump on his leg removed, and the one on his chest. He's doing fine, great even...he's been a stalwart companion the whole time he has been with me. That's why I'm so broken up right now...he's 10, he won't be with me forever. And I'm starting to see signs on the horizon of that. It started with his muzzle turning grey, and then he started sleeping in longer in the mornings. It's more effort to stand up off the couch, rough breathing at night. Things like that. He's still got a lot of mileage left, though. It's been hell over the last 3 days keeping him from bouncing off the wall with a dozen staples in his leg and more in his chest, so I'm not real worried right now.

But it's inevitable.

So, being awake in the middle of the night, and unable to sleep because I know that someday I will lose my best, longest-standing, and most faithful friend, I started wondering how best I could honor him and the memories he will leave me with.

First, I'm going to make the most of the time that we've got left. Wallowing in this future pain makes no rational sense, because I'll have to pass through that gate eventually. But I can make more memories, even if one half dies with Wilbur and the other with me. Which is probably part of this emotional trainwreck...it's bringing my own mortality, and that of everyone I love, to light.

Second, I'll write down all of the memories that we have together, so that I have something to look back on. I haven't taken enough pictures of the middle of his life; I've always been terrible about that. But I've got ones from the day I brought him home, and other good pictures and memories throughout our time together. I'll start to take more, or better yet have Tracy (or Stella!) do that, so I can get in some of them. But the big thing is going to be the memories, so that I don't forget those.
